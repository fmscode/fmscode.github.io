        </h2>
        <p><p>With the release of the new generation of game consoles I adopted a new policy to only digitally download games instead of buying physical discs. I’ve never been a fan of physical media and hated having to go to a store and purchase game. Video Games are the most painful to buy in store because every GameStop I went to had two things in common. First are little kids whining to their parents to buy them a $60 game and the constant harassing to pre-order a game or buy some add-on for something I don’t care about. To not deal with this I have only purchased games for my Xbox One digitally. At first it was great and made me more willing to buy games since I didn’t need to go to a store and deal with the in-store environment. This allowed me to essential hide my Xbox from my TV area since I don’t have to put discs in when I want to play a game, which is a small and lazy thing but something I like. </p>

<p>This all changed with the release of Destiny. I played Destiny during the beta period and loved it, so when the game was released early last week I purchased the game and season pass for $98. It was great because the game pre-downloaded to my Xbox and was ready to play right away. After playing for a couple of hours I quickly changed my mind about Destiny and found the game very repetitive and lacking of a good storyline. </p>

<p>The issue is that I can’t return the game or trade the game in to help recoup the initial cost. And I fully understood this going into only buying digital downloads, but there should be some kind of system to help reduce the price of digital downloads. The best solution right now seems to be what EA is trying out with a subscription based service for games, similar to Netflix with their streaming service. I think going forward digital streaming services for games will become much more requested and used since it is a good balance of digital games and the ability to reduce the price of video games. To make this work though the game publishers will probably have to take a pricing hit since most new games are around $60 and the subscription service will have to be below that for there to be any hope of success in these new subscription services.</p>

        </h2>
        <p><p>The first language I had ever written any code in was Objective-C. I taught myself everything about Objective-C that I could find in online tutorials, books, and Apple documentation. Being my first language, I thought Objective-C was the best language and nothing would come close to it. Even after I expanded out and taught myself PHP, Ruby, and JavaScript I always thought Objective-C was the most well rounded and complete language. I was also writing Objective-C when there was no such thing as ARC and you had to manually manage your memory. Even with its shortcomings, I loved Objective-C and everything you could do with it and how easy it was for me to pick up.</p>

<p>When Swift was announced in June at WWDC I was not as excited as others were about a new programming language. Throughout my four years of Objective-C development I had never come across anything that I would have blamed Objective-C for, most of my blame went to the Cocoa/Cocoa Touch APIs. While I had little excitement for Swift, I did download the <em>The Swift Programming Language</em> iBook and started to play around with Swift in Xcode Playgrounds. And while there were plenty of shortcuts to make things “easier” to write, nothing stood out to the point where I wanted to drop everything and start writing Swift only. I also wasn’t getting excited since Apple said they would be changing the syntax based on developer feedback, which was great for the language and really helped it grow in the past two months. The last thing that held me back was I wanted to write an App that used some of the new Extension functionality of iOS 8 and Yosemite, but every time a issue/bug came up it was difficult to figure out if it was a Swift language issue, beta OS limitation, or me writing buggy code. After a few weeks I decided to put Swift aside and continue to write Objective-C code.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until a week ago that I had some free time and re-downloaded the <em>The Swift Programming Language</em> and <em>Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C</em> iBook along with the latest Xcode. This time when I used Swift I quickly found myself loving the shortcuts and the various improvements it has over Objective-C and found myself wanting to convert some of my projects over to Swift. I’ve even had issues going back to Objective-C for work projects since I would try to write Swift code and it would cause errors, mainly me not adding a semicolon. Over the past two months Swift has matured and I can’t wait to see how it grows over its life.</p>

        <p><p>3 Months, 197 commits, 13061 additions and 17107 deletions. These are the pull request statistics for Pinball Map, an app I have been working on for the past 3 months with two other developers.</p>

<p>This app represented a lot of firsts for me as a developer. My first time working with other developers/designers, who were great during the entire development process, that I did not know from my current job. First time contributing to a Rails app to help build the public <a href="http://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs">Pinball Map API</a> that powers the app. First time I had a formal set of testers and proper beta releases, actually 6 beta releases to be exact. Overall it was a great experience and can’t wait to ship the next version.</p>

<p>The app is available in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/portland-pinball-map/id359275713?mt=8">App Store</a> and a gallery of screenshots are below.</p>

        </h2>
        <p><p>When switching from springs and struts to Auto Layout in a recent project I found that my animations would occasionally break. For the longest time I always used animateWithDuration:animations: to alter the frame of a view. However, when you want to animate a view controlled by Auto Layout the process is a little different and requires some setup first. </p>

<h1 id="example">Example</h1>
<p>Below is the type of animation we are trying to accomplish.</p>

<h2 id="springs--struts">Springs &amp; Struts</h2>
<p>To accomplish this animation simply wrap the frame code inside of an animateWithDuration:animations: block.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c"><span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">UIView</span> <span class="nl">animateWithDuration</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mf">0.5</span> <span class="nl">animations</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="n">_sideView</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">frame</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">CGRectMake</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">320</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">320</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">480</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}];</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="auto-layout">Auto Layout</h2>
<p>The first step to animating in Auto Layout is to ensure that your view is properly setup with all necessary constraints. Once that is setup you will need to create a reference to the constraint that you will want to animate. In this example you will need to create a reference to the constraint that controls the space between the left side of a view and it’s superview. If you are using Interface Builder to setup your constraints, simply make an IBOutlet to the constraint in your View Controller.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c"><span class="k">@property</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">nonatomic</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="kt">IBOutlet</span> <span class="bp">NSLayoutConstraint</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">leftSide</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>After making the connection you are now ready to animate the view. You will first set the new constant for the constraint, then in your animateWithDuration:animations: block you will call its superviews layoutIfNeeded. It is important to call the proper view that is controlling the layout of the animated view. In this example we would call it on self.view since it is controlling the layout of the constraint.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c"><span class="n">_leftSide</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">constant</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">320</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">UIView</span> <span class="nl">animateWithDuration</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mf">0.5</span> <span class="nl">animations</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">view</span> <span class="n">layoutIfNeeded</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}];</span></code></pre></div>

<p>While animating Auto Layout does require more setup, the code is a little more straight forward and cleaner than Springs &amp; Struts code.</p>

        </h2>
        <p><p>Recently I had to learn how to setup Auto Layout constraints within code. The usual method of setting up Auto Layout is through a storyboard with Interface Builder. Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/UserExperience/RNAutomaticLayout/index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010631-CH1-SW3">documentation</a> on how to write constraints in code, but I thought they fell short on providing real world examples. I still highly recommend reading the documentation since it does describe what the syntax is for writing these constraints in more detail than this post will.</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>There are two very important steps to do before writing constraints.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set “translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints” to false on the view you plan on applying constraints to. If you do not set this property on the view, nothing will work properly due to conflicting constraints.</li>
  <li>Add the view to your superview before applying the constraints.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stretch-to-fill-screen">Stretch to fill screen</h2>
<p>The first example is applying constraints to a table view. When you turn your device, and you support landscape orientation, the expected behavior is for the table view to expand and fill the entire screen. To do this within code, setup two constraints on the superview for the horizontal and vertical alignment. First the horizontal code:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c"><span class="bp">NSArray</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">horizontalTable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">NSLayoutConstraint</span> 
	<span class="nl">constraintsWithVisualFormat</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;H:|-(0)-[table]-(0)-|&quot;</span> 
	<span class="nl">options</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">NSLayoutFormatAlignmentMask</span> 
	<span class="nl">metrics</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">nil</span> 
	<span class="nl">views</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="l">@{</span><span class="s">@&quot;table&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">tableView</span><span class="l">}</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The VisualFormat parameter is what defines the rule. The basic format for a constraint is “Orientation:Secondary View-(Constant)-[Primary View]-(Constant)-Secondary View”.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Orientation</strong>: Either “H” or “V” for horizontal and vertical.</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary View</strong>: The view to the left and right for horizontal constraints, or directly above and below for vertical constraints.</li>
  <li><strong>Constant</strong>: The actual value for the constraint to follow.</li>
  <li><strong>Primary View</strong>: The view we want the constraint to apply to.</li>
</ul>

<p>This format string is essentially saying to keep 0 pixels between the table and the superview on the left and right side.</p>

<p>With the hard part over, there are just a few more parameters.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The options parameter should be set to “NSLayoutFormatAlignmentMask”, since we are defining both left and right constraints. </li>
  <li>For this example, metrics does not need to be set.</li>
  <li>The last important part of the constraint is the “views” dictionary. This is where you link your format string to actual views. In the format string we declared “table” as a view, so we need to link that to an actual view in our view hierarchy. To create this link we pass a dictionary with a key “table” then pass our actual table as its value.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have setup the horizontal constraint, the vertical constraint is very similar. The main difference is the use of “V” instead of “H”.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c"><span class="bp">NSArray</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">verticalTable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">NSLayoutConstraint</span> 
	<span class="nl">constraintsWithVisualFormat</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;V:|-(0)-[table]-(0)-|&quot;</span> 	<span class="nl">options</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">NSLayoutFormatAlignmentMask</span> 
	<span class="nl">metrics</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">nil</span> 
	<span class="nl">views</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="l">@{</span><span class="s">@&quot;table&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">tableView</span><span class="l">}</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></div>

<p>To apply these constraints we add them to the superview since it is taking care of the layout in this example.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c"><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">view</span> <span class="nl">addConstraints</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">horizontalTable</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">view</span> <span class="nl">addConstraints</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">verticalTable</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></div>

<p>If you run your project and rotate your device, you will see that the table will stretch to fill the screen as expected.</p>

<h2 id="bottom-toolbar">Bottom Toolbar</h2>
<p>When you have a toolbar within a view it usually belongs fixed to the bottom of the view.</p>

<p>The first constraint will be for the horizontal alignment, which will look similar to the table view horizontal constraint.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c"><span class="bp">NSArray</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">horizontalToolbar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">NSLayoutConstraint</span> 
	<span class="nl">constraintsWithVisualFormat</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;H:|-(0)-[toolbar]-(0)-|&quot;</span> 
	<span class="nl">options</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">NSLayoutFormatAlignmentMask</span> 
	<span class="nl">metrics</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">nil</span> 
	<span class="nl">views</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="l">@{</span><span class="s">@&quot;toolbar&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">actionsBar</span><span class="l">}</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The vertical alignment is a little bit different since we want the view to be pinned to the bottom of the view.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-objective-c" data-lang="objective-c"><span class="bp">NSArray</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">verticalToolbar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="bp">NSLayoutConstraint</span> 
	<span class="nl">constraintsWithVisualFormat</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s">@&quot;V:[toolbar]-(0)-|&quot;</span> 
	<span class="nl">options</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">NSLayoutFormatAlignAllBottom</span> 
	<span class="nl">metrics</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="nb">nil</span> 
	<span class="nl">views</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="l">@{</span><span class="s">@&quot;toolbar&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">actionsBar</span><span class="l">}</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The difference here is that we only have the superview pipe character as the last item. This is because we want the view pinned to the bottom of its superview.</p>

<p>Now add the constraints to the superview and run the app. You should have a toolbar that is pinned to the bottom of the view.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>While working with Auto Layout in code is not as easy compared to creating them in Interface Builder, it is still very useful to know in case you ever want to create a view in code rather than in a storyboard or nib.</p>
