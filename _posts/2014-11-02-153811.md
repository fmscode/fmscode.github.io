Just found a great [post](http://allara.blogspot.co.uk/2010/12/total-line-count-for-your-xcode-project.html) about totaling lines of code in Xcode Projects. You can easily modify the command to support .swift files to give you an idea of how much smaller your Swift project is as compared to Objective-C.

	find . -name "*.swift" -print0 | xargs -0 wc -l // Must be used when you are in your project's source directory
