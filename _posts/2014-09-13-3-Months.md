3 Months, 197 commits, 13061 additions and 17107 deletions. These are the pull request statistics for Pinball Map, an app I have been working on for the past 3 months with two other developers.

This app represented a lot of firsts for me as a developer. My first time working with other developers/designers, who were great during the entire development process, that I did not know from my current job. First time contributing to a Rails app to help build the public [Pinball Map API](http://pinballmap.com/api/v1/docs) that powers the app. First time I had a formal set of testers and proper beta releases, actually 6 beta releases to be exact. Overall it was a great experience and can't wait to ship the next version.

The app is available in the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/portland-pinball-map/id359275713?mt=8) and a gallery of screenshots are below.
