title: Working With CocoaPods
---
Over the past week I've been working on the drawing functionality of my new app. Along the way I thought this control would be useful if I abstracted it enough for any project to use. I also wanted to take this opportunity to publish the control as a CocoaPod and not just a basic open source project. I have been using CocoaPods recently and find them incredibly useful to the development process of iOS.

Overall it was easy, a single command creates the directory and all the required files to start working on the pod. The [CocoaPod documentation][1] is well written and clearly describes everything for the process. I had a good experience building the pod and publishing it, and can't wait to build more CocoaPods in the future.

The pod is called DrawView and is available on GitHub https://github.com/fmscode/DrawView or by adding "pod DrawView" to your Podfile.
